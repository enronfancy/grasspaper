% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Grass is very import element of nature and grass modeling, rendering as well as simulation are wildly used in many 3D applications. Existing manual grass modeling methods are not able to precisely describe the blade shape, moreover there are so many different blade types that it is not possible to preset them in any system. Different from hairs which are usually represented as lines, grasses are normally showed as blade and their shapes are often constrained by two curves rather than one. In order to capture and model grass blades, single lines are not enough to reconstruct blade shape. We introduce a system that reconstructs blades contour by analysis depth coherence, and contours can best describe grass blade shape. We design a blade simplification and refinement method according to each vertice's movement similarity. This method ensures that every simplified model retain the maximum movement accuracy in simulation, which has not been considered by existing grass modeling and simulation methods. Our system is able to interactively capture grass blade shape, refine blade model and apply to rendering and simulation on real-time. We show a variety of captured results as well as realistic rendering and simulation effects.

\IEEEPARstart{G}{rass} is a significant feature of natural world and it is indispensable in most 3D games and movies .Therefore the modeling, rendering and simulation of grass become an essential field of computer graphics and visualization. When an object passes on a grassland, every grass blade on the path is pushed aside or run over, and gradually recovers its shape afterwards. Individual responses from every single grass blade greatly improve viewers' experience for virtual environment and increase scene's fidelity. Realistic modeling for grass blade rendering is not easy since grass blade shape varies a lot. Artists usually disregard the importance of grass blades modeling for their simple structure, meanwhile the lack of realistic grass blade model becomes a frequent issue when creating virtual scenes for games and other 3D applications.\\

Grass modeling, rendering and simulation may not be so difficult for a single blade, however challenge comes when quantity is taken into consideration. Geometry-based modeling is used in most methods where structures are represented as triangles. Nevertheless when there is requirement for large quantity of grass blades, vertex amount for a single grass blade is strictly limited to a very small number for the sake of high performance. Modeling realistic grass blade with vertex amount restriction is challenging, no mater manually or recovering from images or videos. Existing method usually use manually pre-designed grass blade models\cite{wang2005dynamic}\cite{belyaev2011real}, these models are created according to artist's experience and lack variety. At the same time, we are not able to judge whether these models are good enough to represent a specific grass blade type. As compared with hair, which could be described with line segments while grass blade needs at least two curves as shape constraint edge. Grass blade has far more kinds of shapes and structures meanwhile there are often much more grass blades required for rendering and simulation than hairs in most cases. Present hair capture methods only capture line segments and generate wisps for hair representation. As for grass, how to capture grass blade shape becomes a new challenge. Simulation for hair is rather a group problem since movements for hairs are quite similar. Thus hairs can be divided into groups and guide hairs are usually used as representatives for a group in simulation. Since head movement is the major cause of hair movement and head movement range is rather small and highly predictable, it greatly reduces the difficulty of hair simulation. Previous works about grass simulation also employ the idea of crow animation, however individual reaction for a single grass blade is far more important since collision's direction, strength is different for each blade. Crow animation greatly reduce the fidelity of virtual scenes thus real grass blades cannot be simply divided into groups and only simulate one of a few of them in each group. Besides, grass blades have stationary shapes, they should recover their shapes and positions after collision.\\

In this paper we present a novel and effective framework for extremely large amount of grass blades modeling, rendering and simulation. Our framework is able to capture grass blade from camera, refine grass blade shape and render large scale grassland scene with high quality as well as realistic simulation response to collisions. By analyzing depth coherence of grass blades, blade contour is extracted by segmenting background. Contour extraction is difficult and slow with image based methods, nevertheless we are able to obtain contour on real time, this allow us to provide interactive operation for users so that they could adjust extraction result according to instant feedback. After obtaining blade contour, a particle-flow method is used to do partition by analyzing the distance of any point on the contour to the center of a grass cluster. This method could capture accurate blade contour of any shape and calculate blade's skeleton. We expand blade skeleton to real blade before rendering to save storage required by extremely large quantity of grass blades.\\

In order to deal with large number of grass blades, triangle amount for a single grass blade is strictly restricted. As captured contour and blade skeleton is usually composed with numerous vertices, there may be hundreds of triangles for a single needed for rendering. Thus this blade model must be simplified and refined before using. We introduces a blade skeleton simplification and refinement algorithm. This algorithm  takes geometry fidelity and vertices¡¯ movement similarity into account simultaneously so that simplified model could best describe blade shape, meanwhile it also retains blade's movement accuracy in simulation. This iterative algorithm allow us to simplify blade model to any level we want. We also set up a standard to evaluate our refined model.\\

In our system every single grass blade has individual and realistic response to collision. We apply GPU-based instancing to lower the requirement for memory and bandwidth, and pay simulation costs only when needed. Meanwhile, this is a tile-based rendering and simulation system, no per-tile data is store unless simulation for a specific tile is required. We implement the method introduced by Han et al.\cite{han2012real} to simulate our grass blade and extend the method introduced by Fan et al.\cite{fan2015simulation} to do tile management. Unlike any simulation only for key blades or hairs in the scene, each grass blade could have separate movement and independent collision to objects. Real-time performance is achieved with more than one million grass blades and hundreds of objects. Instant shape switching is allowed in our system during rendering and simulation.\\

Our main contributions are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interactive grass blade capturing method, which is able to capture grass blade contour, extract blade skeleton and calculate expansion width;
\item Blade skeleton simplification and refinement method according to vertices' movement similarity;
\item Extension for large scale grassland rendering as well as simulation method with high fidelity, which allow instant shape switching during rendering and simulation.

\section{Related Work}
The most challenging part of grass modeling, rendering and simulation is caused by extremely large quantity. William Reeves and Ricki Blau\cite{reeves1985approximate} addressed those challenges in 1985. Works about grass mainly discuss the following three topics: grass modeling, rendering and simulation. For modeling and rendering,  Kajiya et al.\cite{kajiya1989rendering} introduced volumetric textures(texels) for short fur rendering. Texels can used to solve spatial aliasing problem. Neyret extended this work to simulate natural scenes such as realistic grass\cite{neyret1996synthesizing} \cite{neyret1998modeling}. Polygons stacks as well as semi-transparent textures were used in implementation of texels\cite{meyer1998interactive}. Brook et al\cite{bakay2002real} improved this method to obtain high rendering performance. Image-based method was used in grass rendering in 2005\cite{shah2005real}. This method used bidirectional texture function for grass. Through length preserving free-form deformation of the 3D skeleton lines of each grass blade and alpha test to implement transparent texture mapping, wang el al. modeled grasses of different shapes with rich details\cite{wang2005dynamic}. Boulanger et al. introduced a level-of-detail(LOD) method for grass rendering with realistic dynamic light and shadow effects\cite{boulanger2009rendering}. A method to modeling withering grass was introduced by Wen et al.\cite{wu2012using} using time-varying texels, this method employed a hybrid texel-and-points scheme, allowing the volume models to handle time-varying simulations. In previous works about grass simulation, grass blades were pushed away when interaction between grass blades and objects happens\cite{guerraz2003procedural}\cite{belyaev2011real}. Qiu et al. proposed propose a method for dynamic simulation of grass field swaying in wind\cite{qiu2012dynamic}. Spring-mass system was also used to model grass blade and simulate grass-object interaction\cite{chen2010real}\cite{hempe2013generation}.  We adopt the simulation algorithm introduced by Han et al.\cite{han2012real}. This method treated collision as hard constraint, meanwhile treated length, bending and twisting as soft constraints in the anastacio2006modelingiterative solver for grass-object interaction. We employ the rendering and simulation framework introduced by \cite{fan2015simulation}. With this frame work, we are able to perform collision computation on GPU and do grass blade instancing on the fly.  We implement our capture method on the basis of this framework to obtain more accurate and diverse grass types.\\

A number of works for leaf and flora reconstruction have reference value for our method since we want to recover grass blade model. There are some previous works about using interactive method to generate or reconstruct leaf shapes and tree shapes\cite{mundermann2003modeling}\cite{okabe2005interactive}\cite{anastacio2006modeling}\cite{chen2008sketch}\cite{pirk2012plastic}.Quan et al.\cite{quan2006image} introduced a method to model plant from a dozen of images. This method could recover plant's shape automatically while relying on user to provide some hints for segmentation. Tan et al.\cite{tan2007image} proposed a method to generate 3D trees from images. They populated tree leaves from segmented source images and used shape patterns of visible branches to predict occluded branches. Tree modeling from single image was introduced afterwards\cite{tan2008single}. Yan et al.\cite{yan2014flower} came up with a method for flower reconstruction from a single image, which used a cone fitting scheme to maintains flower shape.Bradley et al.\cite{bradley2013image} presented a scale technique to compute 3D structure of foliage and extract leaf shapes. \\

Capturing grass blade with camera has not been explored much, however plenty of researches about hair capture have been conducted. There are some similarities between hair and grass blade for their shapes and movement features. Chai et al.\cite{chai2012single} uses single image to do hair modeling, they captured hair style from image and were able to render origin hair style at different angle, with different hair materials and change hair style . Afterwards, they extended their work through user's high-level knowledge to get more accurate hair that matches image and waa physically real at the same time. By doing it they were able to finish dynamic hair simulation and interactive hair style editing, which made it possible to apply this hair manipulation in video\cite{chai2013dynamic}. A structure-aware hair capture method\cite{luo2013structure} was introduced in 2013, authors adopted a method to generate hair strand segments, set up a connection graph to guarantee hair growth to areas with missed geometry information and connected hair strands with consistent curvature. A method to capture hair using simulated examples was introduced by Hu et al.\cite{hu2014robust}, they used simulated samples as references to generate hair, and this method could be applied with unconstrained and constrained hair. They also came up with a method to capture braided hair style\cite{hu2014capturing}. A data-driven reconstruction method was adopted in this scheme and procedurally generated examples were used to fit captured hair strands. Xu et al.\cite{xu2014dynamic} introduced a space-time optimization method to capture dynamic hair. This method could faithfully capture hair strands' shape as well as spatial details. However, hair capturing, reconstruction and simulation methods cannot be directly used for grass. Grass blade shape is much more complex and cannot be simply captured as line segments. There are more constraints need for grass blade description than hair, width, curvature of blade and so on. Besides, hair simulation methods cannot handle individual collision response for each hair, however it is essential for grass blades since each grass blade is more visually obvious than a hair. Group simulation and animation greatly reduce scene fidelity.\\

After capturing, we need to simplify our grass blade model so that it could be applied in real scenes. This is very similar to many Level-of-detail(LOD) methods, which are typical model simplification algorithms. They are used to simplify model geometry complexity and accelerate rendering as well as simulation performance. Framework used to obtain a constant frame rate for visualization of virtual environments was introduced in 1993\cite{funkhouser1993adaptive}. Geometry-based LOD algorithms including quad remeshing methods were summarized in \cite{bommes2013quad}. Field-guided parameterization-based methods split quad remeshing into three steps including cross-field computation, integer-grid parameterization and quad mesh extraction\cite{ray2006periodic}\cite{kalberer2007quadcover}
\cite{bommes2009mixed}\cite{zhang2010wave}. Except for those geometry-based LOD algorithms, level-of-detail was also used in simulation method. Techniques for reducing the computational complexity for simulations was introduced by Carlson et al.\cite{simulation1997Deborah}. LOD was also used for animation and rendering of prairies and particle systems\cite{o2001automatic}. Our skeleton refining method is similar to LOD algorithms, moreover we take simulation fidelity into account while simplifying grass blade model. This leads to more accurate model for rendering and simulation at the same time and we are able to balance the trade-off between performance and quality.\\

\section{Algorithm Overview}


\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/overview2.jpg}
    \captionof{figure}{Overview of system pipeline: First capture a cluster of grass blades and obtain depth depth image, those are raw data in our system; then extract blade contour and partition the contour for a single blade marked with different color respectively; next calculate skeleton and expansion width; then simplify and refine calculated skeleton starting with 128 vertices, skeleton vertices are reduced down to 64, 32 and 16 with different refining levels; second line: generate a grass patch, randomize grass blades orientation and location in a tile; then assign grass data for each tile from the patch; finally render the scene with our captured and simplified blade mesh.}
    \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure*}

We introduce a novel and effective framework that is able to capture grass blade model from depth camera, simplify the model and finally finish rendering and realistic individual simulation for each grass blade for very large scale grassland. An overview of our algorithm is shown in Figure.\ref{fig:overview}.\\

 Through analyzing depth coherence of grass blades in a depth image, we extract blade contour by segmenting background. We are able to obtain contour on real time with depth camera, and this helps us provide users with interactive operations. With our system, users could adjust extraction result according to instant feedbacks on the screen. A particle-flow method\cite{neubert2007approximate} is used to do blades partition by analyzing the distance of any point on the contour to the center of the grass cluster. Single blade model is obtained after partition process. Our method could capture accurate blade contour of any shape and calculate blade's skeleton. We only store blade's skeleton as well as width data, and expand blade skeleton to real blade before rendering to save storage required by extremely large quantity of grass blades.\\

As for grass skeleton calculated from blade's contour, usually it has too many vertices so that it cannot be used directly in our system. Therefore we design an simplifying and refining algorithm to reduce vertex amount whiling maintaining its geometry as well as simulation features at the same time. This process is similar to level-of-detail(LOD), however previous LOD algorithm only take geometry information into account, which is not sufficient to keep grass blade's features in simulation. Thus we bring in movement similarity amount vertices to solve this problem.\\

We adopt the GPU instancing scheme used in \cite{fan2015simulation}. We pre-generate a list of grass blade called grass patch. Grass scene is divided into a grid of tiles. Grass blades in each tile are specific number of continuous blades fetched from grass patch. Starting position in grass patch for each tile is calculated by tile's position in the scene. Blade's skeleton is expanded to triangles before rendering. Phong shading model is used in grass blade rendering for the sake of high performance. Subsurface scattering effects is also used in our system to increase fidelity\cite{sousa2007vegetation}. Tile management guarantee per-blade memory is allocated only when simulation is needed. We extend this method so that we support instant shape switching during rendering and simulation according to capturing and simplified grass blade model.\\

\section{Algorithm Details}\label{sec:detail}
\subsection{Blade Capture and Partition}\label{sec:capture}
we aim to capture grass blade without manual operations and use capture result in the rendering and simulation system immediately after capturing. Skeleton knots number limits the detail level of our grass blade, however it also requires efficient refining algorithm to convert captured skeleton into appropriate blade model in our system. Motivated by other hair and plant capture methods, we adopt a depth camera to capture grass blade. Depth cameras are deployed in variety of applications and becoming prevailing more than ever, for its advantage to recover shapes and capture movements. With depth camera, we manage to capture grass blade and mask non-grass object on the fly.\\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figs/depth_contour2.jpg}
    \captionof{figure}{(a)Depth image and (b)extracted contour}
    \label{fig:depthimage}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{fig:depthimage} shows the depth image of a cluster of grass blades and its extracted contour. We just use depth information to mask objects that exceed specified depth to get a blob of blades and then extract edge of the blob. Also canny edge detection can be used to extract contour, however depth value, instead of gray is used to do calculation.\\

Individual grass blades are partitioned by a particle-flow method\cite{neubert2007approximate}. After getting the contour of grass blades, the center of the contour can be easily calculated. Then the distance between any point on the contour and center point can be measured. Local minimum points of point-distance function imply the intersection points between adjacent blades. Boundary between two intersection points is contour of a single blade. Figure.\ref{fig:partition} shows the partition result projected in 2D plane.\\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figs/contour_partition2.jpg}
    \captionof{figure}{Single blade partition: Given the (a)contour of a blade cluster,(b)calculate the center point and use particle-flow method to partition each single blade.}
    \label{fig:partition}
\end{figure}

Given the contour of single blade, we could calculate the blade skeleton. According to our observation on plenty kinds of grass blade ,we suppose that captured blade is symmetrical. Then we could calculate skeleton point by matching symmetrical points on contour. Figure.\ref{fig:skeleton} present skeleton calculation according to blade contour. Expansion width for each point of skeleton could also be calculated by symmetrical points' distance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/skeletoncal.jpg}
    \captionof{figure}{Skeleton calculation by match symmetrical points on contour.(a) capture single blade contour points, points index increases from bottom left to bottom right;(b) Matching symmetrical points in the contour.}
    \label{fig:skeleton}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Skeleton Refining}\label{sec:Refining}
Having the blade skeleton calculated from contour, it can't be used in our rendering and simulation system for its large number of vertices. Therefore we come up with a skeleton refining method to simplify our skeleton model. This skeleton refining method is similar to some LOD methods. However most LOD methods are designed for triangle meshes or quad meshes. Our skeleton is represented as a curve and more importantly, we need to take geometry fidelity as well as vertices' movement similarity into account simultaneously while doing simplification. Therefore we design this refining scheme that both geometry and simulation similarities of vertices are important factors in skeleton simplification and fidelity evaluation.\\

In our system, we define any two vertices' movement similarity by the distance between them and their movement trends. For any two vertices, the smaller the distance between them is, the more similar they are. And for any two vertices, we could calculate the distance between them at any time. We could acquire the distance of two vertices every a few millisecond. Then we are able to calculate a series distance data for these two vertices. Variance is usually used to describe data stability. If distance variance is low, it means the distance between two vertices is stable. In another word, this indicate that these two vertices moves synchronously. We tend to merge vertices that moves similarly and keep vertices that have distinct movement features. Assume we acquire $n$ frames every a few milliseconds, $v_{m}^{n}$ is $m$th vertex at $n$th frame, therefore we introduce movement difference of any two vertices as:

\begin{equation}
D(v_{1}, v_{2}) = dis(v_{1}, v_{2})\times \mu + var(v_{1}, v_{2}) \times (1-\mu)
\label{eq:similarityeq}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
dis(v_{1}, v_{2}) = \dfrac{\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{d(v_{1}^{i}, v_{2}^{i})}}{n}
\label{eq:distance}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
var(v_{1}, v_{2}) = (\dfrac{\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{d(v_{1}^{i}, v_{2}^{i})}^{2}}{n} - \dfrac{(\sum_{i = 0}^{n}{d(v_{1}^{i}, v_{2}^{i})})^{2}}{n})
\label{eq:variance}
\end{equation}

$dis$ function represents distance factor and $var$ function represents variance factor. $\mu$ is proportion factor for distance and variance, which can be set by user.\\

We use an iterative algorithm to complete this skeleton refining process. After skeleton calculation, we manage to obtain array of skeleton vertices. We design a greedy algorithm to iteratively merge two adjacent vertices, based on the assumption that if two vertices are the most similar then they should be adjacent vertices in the array. Because distance factor is an very important part in similarity definition, and closer vertices always get lower score for distance factor. This algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm.\ref{tbl:skeletonrefining}.\\

Figure.\ref{fig:skeletonrefining} illustrates a sequence of grass blade with different refining level. Refining level is set by user according to the performance requirement of application and hardware level.

\subsection{Rendering and Simulation}\label{sec:render}
According to our captured grass model and refining result, we pre-generate a list of grass blades with some random scaling.We divide the whole scene into tiles. Those blades in the patch are randomly located in a square which has the same size of grass tile in the scene. Each tile contains a subset of continuous blades in the patch. For each grass tile, its offset in the patch is calculated by tile's position coordinate in the scene. With this instancing scheme, we are able to reduce memory use from about $4$ GB of $4$ M blades to only $24$ MB of for a patch of $16384$ blades. With this patch, we manage to implement a grassland with rich variance.\\

We draw one line segment as two degenerate triangles and expand each knot of this line segment at runtime according to expansion width captured through depth camera. Figure.\ref{fig:expasion} illustrates this expansion process. We employ Phong shading along with subsurface scattering effect\cite{sousa2007vegetation} in our system. In order to avoid a monotone we use a density map in our system. Figure.\ref{fig:density} illustrated our density map generated with Perlin noise\cite{perlin1985image}. \\

\end{figure}
In our simulation system, $Bullet$ is used to handle collision between ground and other object. We use the simulation method introduced by \cite{han2012real} and tile management scheme introduced by \cite{fan2015simulation}. This simulation scheme is compatible with procedural animation. We are able to simulate millions of grass blades with real-time performance. In our system, we use a very small file to save grass blade models that are currently used in the system. During rendering and simulation, our application will detect file status every several frames. This allow instant shape switching and interactive demonstration for captured results.\\

\section{Implementation and Results}
\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/results.jpg}
    \captionof{figure}{Experiment results:(a) regular slim and thin grass blade ;(b) blade similar to most leaves, blade edge is quadratic curve like; (c) blade that is slender than the first one, blade edge is still regular (d) bamboo leaf which is thin, its edge is very smooth and flat except for its top and root; (e) leaf with shape variation, it has a very sharp and narrow tip.}
    \label{fig:results}
\end{figure*}

We implemented our system on a PC with Windows 8.1, Intel i5-4460 CPU running at $3.2$ GHz and AMD Radeon R9-270 graphic card. 4 times multi-sampling anti-aliasing is used in all experiments to guarantee satisfactory visual effect.\\

Instancing rendering is used in our implementation in order to reduce draw call overhead for CPU. Instancing parameters are pre-generated and stored in a structure buffer before rendering. Our rendering scheme is also compatible with different LOD algorithms at far distance.\\

Time stamps are used in our simulation scheme in order to imitate energy dissipation process. Tile activation is triggered when objects enter a tile and deactivation start when all objects leave a tile after a time delay. Since activation and deactivation processes are called so frequently that instant GPU memory allocation would significantly slow down simulation efficiency and becomes the bottleneck of the whole system, we set up a GPU memory pool and pre-allocate GPU memory. We assign memory for tiles that need simulation and recycle as soon as tile deactivation starts.\\

\subsection{Capture, Rendering and Simulation Results}
Our system is evaluated with a variety of grass blades and leaves that can be used for large scale grassland. Our capture algorithm can capture grass blade, partition single blade contour, calculate expansion width and finish skeleton refining with interactive performance. This provide the possibility for user to capture any appropriate kind of grass or leaves and use it for large scale grassland rendering and simulation. This is especially useful for virtual-reality or augmented-reality applications where quick reconstruction of grassland with specific grass blade type is needed. \\



In Figure.\ref{fig:results}(a) we choose a regular kind of grass which is slim ,thin and common to find everywhere.  In (b) we choose a vine and capture its leaf as grass blade. This blade is like a tree leaf, its blade edge can be described as a quadratic curve. In (c) we choose a cluster of leaves from a shrub. This leaf is longer however its blade edge is still regular and quadratic-curve like. In (d) we choose a cluster of bamboo leaves. Bamboo leave is thin and slim, from the figure we could see that its blade edge is very smooth and flat in the middle and it is hard to be described with simple quadratic curves. In(e) we choose a leaf with variation it the top. It has a very sharp and narrow tip which make it special. Camera captured this feature kept it through our expansion width calculation.\\

 \end{table}

We have tested our algorithm to evaluate its rendering and simulation performance. In our system, we need only one draw call to rendering the whole scene, which greatly reduce CPU overhead. We are able to render a scene of $14926$ tiles in $20$ ms, in total there are $955264$ blades and over $29$ million triangles. In table.\ref{table:frameprofile}, profiling data for simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our system. Simulation time for a single blade decreases with the increase of simulated tiles as listed in the table. This gives the evidence that our system is suitable to solve the high simulation cost problem caused by extremely large grassland.\\

\subsection{Skeleton Refining Evaluation}
For error measurement of meshes, several methods such as the use error metric of average squared distance were used in previous works\cite{garland1997surface}. Our grass blade skeleton is represented as a curve, in order to measure the effectiveness of our skeleton refining algorithm, we use a Hausdorff-Fit method to evaluate the refining result. We intend to measure the "distance" between refined skeleton and the original one before refining, as it is demonstrated in Figure.\ref{fig:distance}. This is very similar to error metric or energy term used in previous methods. Hausdorff distance is usually used to measure how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other\cite{wikihausdorff}. Hausdorff distance is the maximum distance of a set to the nearest point in the other set.\\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figs/distance.jpg}
    \captionof{figure}{Distance between refined skeleton and original skeleton calculated from blade contour.}
    \label{fig:distance}
\end{figure}

Hausdorff distance is usually defined as:

\begin{equation}
d_{H}(X,Y) = \max\{\sup_{x \in X }\inf_{y \in Y}d(x,y), \sup_{y \in Y}\inf_{x \in X} d(x,y)\}
\label{eq:hausdorff}
\end{equation}

where $sup$ represents the supremum of the set and $inf$ represents the infimum. $X$, $Y$ are two sets while $x$, $y$ are elements that belong to $X$, $Y$ respectively. In our method, Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity of refined skeleton and the original one before refining. However, since the skeleton after refining could be a sub set of the original one, hausdorff distance could become meaningless in that case. Therefore we eliminate the vertices from original skeleton vertex set $\alpha$ if they are also in refined skeleton vertex set $\beta$, let $\alpha' = \alpha - \beta $, then we calculate the hausdorff distance from $\alpha'$ to $\beta$. In this way we actually measure the distance between the culled vertex set and the remained vertex set after refining. Algorithm for our method is demonstrated in algorithm.\ref{tbl:skeletonrefiningeva} where $d_H$ is refined hausdorff distance used in our algorithm.\\

        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

We recorded vertex data from several frames according to our simulation algorithm. Simulation for original skeleton vertices and refined skeleton vertices are conducted at the same time. Then we calculate $d_H$ as in algorithm.\ref{tbl:skeletonrefiningeva} in each frame for the results of different refining methods. For the needs of comparison, we introduces several other schemes used for skeleton refining. Random method selects vertices randomly from original vertex set. Mean method select vertices evenly along the skeleton from the root to the top. only geometry information is used in geometry-based refining algorithm. It iteratively merge vertices with shortest distance of the skeleton. Since grass blade skeleton is represented as a curve, many LOD methods for meshes could degenerate to it eventually. Refining error is represented as $d_H$. From Figure.\ref{fig:evaresults} we could see that our skeleton refining algorithm always gets the lowest error among the methods listed above. Mean method is a intuitive method used in manual grass blade modeling, however it is not a good choice proved with our experiments. Geometry-based simplification is widely used however, it gets higher refining error since it only considers static mesh structure while for dynamic scenes, simulation similarity helps to get a more accurate grass blade model.\\

\textbf{Limitations.} Restricted by vertex amount of grass blade, our method has some limitations. First, small vertex amount is not enough to model jagged blades or leaves. Sharp variation in shape definitely need more vertices to remain such features. However, vertex amount is severely restricted by performance requirements, we need to balance vertex amount and performance at the same time. Meanwhile, due to the structure of grass blade we use in our system, we are not able to handle horizontally curly blades.  Secondly, since we choose to do instancing before rendering and expand grass blade at runtime, moreover our skeleton calculation by matching points will run into difficulties when dealing with asymmetric grass blades or leaves. Thirdly, the center point calculation of a grass blade cluster requires appropriate pose for camera and blade cluster, causing some accuracy problem if the poses are not proper. Fourthly, depth image capture by depth camera only support a maximum resolution of $640\times 480$ pixels, this will cause some problem when we want to capture some small and thin grass blades. Hopefully this problem would be solved with the development of hardware and popularity of depth camera.\\

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a framework for capturing grass blade with depth camera, expansion width calculation and skeleton extraction. We utilize a increasingly popular depth camera and take advantage of depth information provided by depth camera to accomplish efficient capturing. We extract a blob of blades according to objects' depth range and calculate its edge to obtain a contour. A particle-flow method is used to partition single blade's contour from a cluster of blades. Based on a single blade's contour, we calculate a skeleton by matching symmetrical vertices on the contour and expansion width for each vertices of the skeleton. A skeleton refining process according to vertices' movement similarity is introduced to reduce skeleton vertex number so that it can be used in the rendering and simulation system with acceptable performance. As for rendering, we adopt a GPU-instanced scheme reduce memory usage. A tile management method is employed to pay simulation cost for those tiles only when needed.\\

Our proposed method concentrate on capturing grass blade shape and refining its structure so that it can be used in the rendering and simulation method for large scale grassland. We are able to a variety of grass blades. We would like to extend our method to handle more complex blade shapes or capture other kind of plants. Furthermore, our method does not handle grass fracture and deformation. Skeleton and expansion width calculation may get incorrect result with such cases. We plan to handle grass fracture in future works and add support for structurally different vegetation.\\

In summary, our work demonstrate how interactive capturing method can be developed to model grass blade and use it in rendering and simulation frameworks. This work can be extended to many fields and inspire other capturing and modeling method for plants and other relative objects.\\
